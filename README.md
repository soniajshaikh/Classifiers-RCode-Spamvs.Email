# spam_vs_email
In this R code, I describe and test various machine learning models as applied to statistics such as Linear Discriminant Analysis, KNN, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests to classify 'spam' from 'emails' in a large data set. This code also compares these models to find the one with the predictive accuracy or lowest misclassification error.
